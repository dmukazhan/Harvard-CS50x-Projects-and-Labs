#### Description:

## Gmail Clone
Welcome to the Gmail Clone project, a reproduction of the well-known email service, Gmail. This project was designed with the purpose of recreating the fundamental features of Gmail, including sending and receiving emails, labeling emails for better organization, searching for specific emails, saving drafts, and even detecting spam.

With this project, I aim to provide a platform that emulates the basic functionalities of Gmail, allowing users to experience the features of Gmail without having to leave the comfort of their own codebase.

### Key Features
Secure User Authentication: To ensure the privacy and security of users' information, this project features robust user authentication that keeps all user data safe and secure.
Email Sending and Receiving: Users can send and receive emails just like they would on the real Gmail platform, with the added advantage of customizing the process within their own codebase.
Labeling for Organization: Emails can be organized into labels for easy retrieval, just like on Gmail. Labels can be created, edited, and deleted to meet the needs of the user.
Search Functionality: A powerful search function has been incorporated into this project, allowing users to easily find the emails they need based on various criteria such as sender, recipient, subject, and more.
Drafts: If an email is not yet ready to be sent, it can be saved as a draft for later completion and sending. This feature is especially useful for lengthy emails or emails that require a significant amount of thought before they are sent.
Spam Detection: To protect users from unwanted emails, this project includes a spam detection feature that identifies and moves potential spam emails to a designated folder.
### Technologies Used
This project was built using three popular programming languages, JavaScript, Python, and SQL.

JavaScript: The frontend of the project was built using JavaScript.
Python: The backend of the project was built using a Flask framework.
SQL: The database for this project was built using SQL.
